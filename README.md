# One-Month_JavaScript-Online-Course
### I will upload the things that I completed for the Javascript course on One Month to this repository. I can summarize the things that I worked on with 4 steps.
- DOM Manipulation 
- Creating a webpage similar to GIPHY GIF Search Engine by using Giphy API + AJAX and JSON.
- Using SoundCloud API and making a webpage with a live playlist and track searcher.
- By using Google Maps API, creating a map including data about countries and their population and density.
### Thank you Christopher Castiglione for creating this great course.
